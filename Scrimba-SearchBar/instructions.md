# Requirements

## Search Input
    * Takes up 1/3 of the width of its container

## When the user clicks into the search bar:
    * Input grows to the entire width of its parent container with a smooth transition
    * Shrinks back to original size when user clicks away
    * Blue border
    * Bonus: Placeholder text is not visible when the user clicks inside the search bar

## Accessibility
    * For accessibility, form inputs should always have a label. Create a label with a valid for attribute
    * Look up some CSS rules (no need to write them yourself) that hide the search input's label visually but keeps it accessible to screen readers.

## Hints and Help
    * Use a transition to make sure the search bar expands smoothly.

## What to research
    * The :focus psuedo selector
    * A psuedo selector that lets you change placeholder styles
